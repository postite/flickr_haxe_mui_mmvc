# Introduction

Automating developer workflow is a challenge common to all languages and platforms. As the develop,
compile, deploy, test cycle is central to the work both developers and designers undertake, gains in
efficiency can have a profound impact on productivity and general well-being. On top of this,
knowledge and experience can be shared between development teams in the form of powerful, reusable
tasks, reducing the siloing of platform expertise.

There are many solutions to the developer workflow problem; Make, Ant, Maven, Rake, Grunt to name
but a few; but none that met the very unique requirements of a multi-platform SDK. Massive Task is a
bespoke solution to the complexities of compiling native applications for a huge number of devices
from a single code base.

# How it Works

Using Massive Task developers can define development tasks in Haxe. Similar to Ruby Rake, this has 
the advantage of providing developers with an expressive DSL for defining tasks in the same 
language that they use to build applications.

When invoked, mtask compiles a project specific Neko executable and invokes it with the arguments
provided on the command line. This allows developers to leverage both the 
[Neko API](http://haxe.org/api/neko/) and [Neko libraries](http://lib.haxe.org/t/neko) as a base 
for tasks.

# Tasks

Creating a task is as simple as marking a module method with the @task metadata:

```haxe
@task function test(?foo:Bool)
{
	trace(foo);
}
```

Which can be invoked from the command line with:

```shell
$ haxelib run mtask test -foo

true
```

For more information on tasks, see [working with tasks](workflow/tasks) and [working with options](workflow/options).

# Targets

Massive Task provides powerful mechanism for defining compilation targets that strikes a careful 
balance between convenience and configuration. For more information see [working with targets](doc/targets.md)

# Extending

Massive Task also provides extensibility and configuration hooks, allowing developers to share 
plugins and development resources and settings between projects and libraries. For more information 
see [working with configuration](doc/config.md) and [working with plugins](workflow/plugins).
