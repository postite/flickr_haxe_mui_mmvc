# Introduction

Massive Task provides a simple, flexible mechanism for generating files and directory structures 
from predefined templates. The library includes templates for generating projects, source code, 
unit tests and licenses. It is also possible for users, and other libraries to provide additional 
templates to mtask through the same mechanism.


# Using Templates

To create a file or directory from a template, user the create task:

```shell
mtask create project neko HelloWorld
```

The create task takes three arguments:

```shell
mtask create [template] [type] [path]
```

The **template** argument indicates the type of template to create, for example a 
project, source file, unit test or license. Templates share a common set of 
arguments that can be inserted into generated files, as well as custom 
behavior based on type and path.

To get a list of available templates, execute:

```shell
mtask list:template
```

The **type** argument indicates the type of a particular template to create. When 
creating a project, for example, type will create a project configured for a 
particular target workflow â€“ a library, a simple neko program or a dual target 
javascript/flash project:

```shell
mtask create project neko NekoProject
mtask create project haxelib LibraryProject
```

To get a list of available template (in this case license) types, execute:

```shell
mtask list:template license
```

The **path** argument controls the output location of the template. In some cases 
this will be a file path, in others it might be an identifier for the file to 
create. When creating source files, for example, the path is the name of the 
class to create:

```shell
mtask create source class com.example.Example
```

## Project Template Types

MTask includes a number of project templates for different targets. Note that 
the initial type of project does not prevent you from adding more targets 
later in development.

* neko - simple neko target suitable for a command line tool, web app or quick 
  test case
* haxelib - haxelib target and munit test suite, providing a quick starting 
  point for a library
* app - a dual flash/js target UI application
* empty - an empty mtask project


## Source and Test Template Types

MTask provides a convenient mechanism for generating templated source files. 
Source files are generated in the `src` directory, and any package directories 
are created as needed. If a `LICENSE` file is found in the root of the current 
project, it is added to the top of the class as a license header. JavaDoc 
style author metadata is also added based on the value of `user.name`.

To create an empty class:

```shell
mtask create source class com.example.MyInstance
```

To create a class with a main entry point:

```shell
mtask create source main com.example.Main
```

There are also templates for munit test classes, which are created in the 
`test` directory:

```shell
mtask create test class com.example.MyTest
```

To create a test for an instantiatable class, use the `for` type. A test class 
will be created with predefined `setup` and `tearDown` methods creating and 
destroying an instance of the class under test:

```shell
mtask create test for com.example.MyInstance
```

(this will create a test named com.example.MyInstanceTest)

## License Types

MTask provides several license templates to quickly create a project license 
with correct `year` and `user.organization` values.

```shell
mtask create license (bsd|mit|gpl|lgpl) LICENSE
```

## Creating Template Types

It is simple to add an additional type to an existing template. When creating a 
template, the `Create` module resolves the path to copy in the following way:

	[path]/[template]/[type]

The default path is:

	[mtask]/resource/create/

You can add search paths for a project, library, or globally using the 
following:

```haxe
module(mtask.create.Create).addTemplatePath("another/path");
```

For more information about configuring mtask see [configuring MTask](TODO).


# Creating New Templates

To create a new template for a project or library you should subclass 
`mtask.create.Template.File` or `mtask.create.Template.Directory` and register 
the template with the `Create` module:

```haxe
module(mtask.create.Create).addTemplate("changelog", ChangeLogTemplate)
```

Templates are modules and have access to the build environment and properties. 
They configure properties and their output path, resolve the template to copy, 
and then copy it to the path. `File` templates replace tokens with properties:

```haxe
class Greeter extends mtask.create.Template.File
{
	public var noun:String;

	public function new(type:String, path:String)
	{
		super("template", type, path)
		noun = "World";
	}
}
```

And the template file:

	Hello ${noun}

Would generate:

	Hello World

`Directory` templates will only replace tokens in files with the extension 
`.temp` (which is removed when copying).
