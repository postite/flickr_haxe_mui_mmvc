# MDK Overview

These documents introduce the Massivision MDK and give a high level overview of it's tools and 
libraries. It is a good starting point for developers wanting a high level view of the capabilities 
of the MDK.

The SDK provides a number of command line tools for automating developer tasks and interacting with 
third party tool chains, devices and services. These tools are written in Haxe and compiled to 
Neko, a lightweight cross platform virtual machine with a full featured system API. This allows the 
tools to be extended and configured by developers in the same language that is used to build 
MDK applications.
