Javascript/HTML, Flash/AIR and C++/SDL (native Win32, OS X, Linux, Android, iOS)

Includes:

* UI and MVC Frameworks
* Tooling (Build tools, Unit testing, code coverage, IDE plugins)
* Reference Applications
* Device and Platform modules


Core Features
------------------

* Write applications that can target multiple platforms and runtimes
* Highly scalable user interface toolkit
* Seamless integration across multple input types(key, mouse, touch, RCU, etc)
* Multi-resolution asset management
* Platform agnostic events/focus/input/
* Cross platform display APIs (bitmaps, text, shapes, etc)
* Device abstraction layer for common device platform APIS (e.g. native video playback)

**Multi-target benefits**

* Creating and managing multiple device configurations from a single project
* Compiling and packaging applications to multiple platform and device targets
* Automating generation of compile time and run time resources for different targets
* Integrating with external developer tools (unit testing, code coverage, 3rd party SDKs, etc)
